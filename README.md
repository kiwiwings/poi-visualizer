POI Visualizer - a OLE/OOXML browser/editor

A small tool to visualize the content of OLE / OOXML files (e.g. *.xls(x) / *.doc(x) / *.ppt(x)).
I've started to develop this tool due the lack of support for [SSView][1] in Linux ...

As I use it together with the current POI trunk, you might need to download it from the [SVN][2] and use `ant mvn-install` on it.
